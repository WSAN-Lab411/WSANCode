**  File Name    	: HelloWorld_V1.c
**  Version			: 1.0
**  Description		: Introduce to digital I/O of PIC. This program basically
**					  works by displaying the LED attached to PORT B and pin
**					  7th of PORT D. Eight leds at port B use source current,
**					  so, they will turn on if pins at port B at high logic.
**					  Led at port D use sink current, so it will turn on if
**					  pin RD7 at low logic.
