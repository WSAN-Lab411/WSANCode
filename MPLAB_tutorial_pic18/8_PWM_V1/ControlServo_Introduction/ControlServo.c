**	Detail description	: I have use 5 pin to output PWM signal. Those are CCP2B,
**						  P1A through P1D. Although I use CCP1CON, please don't think
**						  that I use PWM (enhanced mode). I use completely standard mode.
**						  If you don't believe, strongly recommend you reference datasheet.
**						  This is basic program to learn to control servo or other motor.
**						  So I think this is helpful for you. Hope you enjoy.
